Now I'm feeling guilty for it
Didn't wanna leave
I got caught up in the forest
Hangin' with the trees
Realised I'm less important
Than I thought I'd be
I'm not tellin' you for any certain reason but
Now I'm feelin' guilty for it
I didn't wanna leave, no
I got caught up in the forest
Hangin' with the trees, yeah, yeah
Realized I'm less important (oh, yeah)
Than I thought I'd be, yeah
I'm not tellin' you for any certain reasons but
I just want your empathy
Our lives keep on gettin' shorter
Losin' opportunity
There might be some other ways of looking at it but
That's just what I see
I been gettin' over myself
Thinkin' about what you need
Then I realised that neither of us matter
What's reality, yeah?
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with you
Couldn't be more different than me
So each time we agree
I feel fulfilled
You always end up stickin' to me
Somehow, somehow
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
So I guess I'll be sticking with
You are stuck with me
