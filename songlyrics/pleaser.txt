You're talking while you're fast asleep
As I walk slowly from your house
Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what I do best
Still I hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead
Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can do
But how am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her
In the sunset, feelings of enjoyment
Hold that thought, I think I need a moment
I'm aware there's something I should tell you
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it any more
'Cause recently the line is blurred
Between depression and bliss
Now I see that the times all change
They waste away
But I just want to sleep today
And I don't want to talk to you right now
You say but
I'm sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can do
But how am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her
I'm talking while you're next to me
Did I ruin the moment?
If I could tell you how I feel
Would you know what the words mean?
For sake of conversation
You should read the writings on my sleeve
'Cause that's the best you're gonna hear
So maybe I better leave
